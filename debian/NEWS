pokerth (0.8.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The pokerth packages was patched since 0.7.1-2 to use
  pokerth.debian.net as the default server. This is not needed any
  more since 0.8-1.

  However, if you had 0.7.1-2 installed, you will have to change the
  settings back to the official server by yourself:
  Set "Serverlist Address" under Settings → Internet Game to
  "pokerth.net/serverlist.xml.z". PokerTH will now fetch the official
  serverlist again.

pokerth (0.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The server at PokerTH.net now runs the 0.8 version of the software,
  which is incompatible with 0.7.x we ship in Squeeze.
  Because of that a 0.7.x server is running on pokerth.debian.net.

  On new installations this will be the default server used.

  On old ones you have to reconfigure your client yourself.
  Either set "Serverlist Address" under Settings → Internet Game to
  "pokerth.debian.net/serverlist.xml.z" or use the "Manual Server
  Configuration" using "pokerth.debian.net" as the server address.
